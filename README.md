# Lily

Synced memory bank for `lily.aolabs.io`.

The public front end is served by GitHub Pages. Shared notes, screenshots, photos, videos, extracted image text, and chat answers are handled by the Railway API service.

User-added data is stored on the Railway `lily-api` service in its persistent `/data` volume. The PIN is checked by the API before memory or media can be read or changed.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Set `public/config.js` to an empty API base for same-origin local API testing, or to the Railway API URL when testing the GitHub Pages front end against production.

## API

- `POST /api/auth` - verify the configured PIN and return an API token
- `GET /api/memories` - list shared memories
- `POST /api/memories` - save notes, image data, and video data
- `DELETE /api/memories/:id` - delete a saved memory
- `GET /api/weights` - list saved weight records
- `POST /api/weights` - save a weight with the server timestamp
- `DELETE /api/weights/:id` - delete a saved weight record
- `GET /api/tracker` - read conflict, longest streak, and period tracker counts
- `POST /api/tracker/conflict` - save a conflict event; an authenticated backfill may include a past `dateKey`
- `POST /api/tracker/period` - save a period start; an authenticated backfill may include a past `dateKey`
- `PATCH /api/tracker/:id` - save reported period-end, high-desire, and possible-ovulation-window dates on a period entry; the high-desire offset predicts future cycle dates
- `DELETE /api/tracker/:id` - delete a saved conflict or period entry
- `POST /api/chat` - answer from saved Lily context

## Weight forecast

The chart calculates one one-year forecast for every saved daily weigh-in, using only that date and the dates before it. Multiple entries on one local date are reduced to their median. A robust damped-trend model is compared with a recent-weight baseline through rolling-origin backtests; the trend model is used only when it improves median error by at least 10%. Trend persistence is capped at `phi <= 0.98`, so short-term movement is never extended as a straight line for all 365 days. The current headline and the final overlay point share the exact same calculated value.

This is a weigh-in-only estimate, not a promise of one-year accuracy. A biological body-weight model would also require inputs such as diet, activity, metabolism, and body composition, and Lily does not currently collect those inputs.

## Deploy To GitHub Pages

The live site is served from the `gh-pages` branch with the custom domain `lily.aolabs.io`.

1. Commit changes on `main`.
2. Copy the updated `public` files into the `gh-pages` deployment worktree.
3. Commit and push `gh-pages`.

## Deploy API To Railway

The Railway project is `lily-app`, service `lily-api`.

```bash
railway up --detach
```

The production API base is `https://lily-api-production.up.railway.app`.
